# sots-tools
This project is a collection of tools required to build "Pokemon Sovereign of the Skies".
It was used in an older version of the game which still used binary modding methods and as since been replaced by a fork of [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald). The tools are therefore only here for achival purposes.
